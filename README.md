## What is this?
Possibly the silliest thing I have ever created...  I needed something to power
me through annotating Asciinema sessions in my favorite text editor.

## How do I use?
1. Go [here](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-player/releases/latest) and
   grab the latest `asciinema-player.css` and `asciinema-player.min.js`.  Place
   them in the root of [this repository](https://github.com/targetdisk/minitator).

2. `xdg-open index.html` (or `open index.html` if you're on a Mac).

3. Install the Minitator plugin in your favorite editor:
  - For Vim/Neovim users: see [this guide](VimHOWTO.md).

See [this document](PlayerHOWTO.md) for more information on using the Minitator
web player UI.

# Documentation
Please do *not* read the markdown docs as hosted on GitHub!  They are correct in
their raw form in the repository, but rendered improperly by GitHub's Markdown
renderer (tables are fscked up).  Please read the docs as hosted on my website
[here](https://sqt.wtf/~targetdisk/tator).
