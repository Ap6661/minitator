## What is this?
Possibly the silliest thing I have ever created...  I needed something to power
me through annotating Asciinema sessions in Vim.

## How do I use?
1. Go [here](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-player/releases/latest) and
   grab the latest `asciinema-player.css` and `asciinema-player.min.js`.  Place
   them in the root of this repository.

2. `xdg-open index.html` (or `open index.html` if you're on a Mac).

3. PROFIT!!!!

## TODO
- [x] Add timestamp element to HTML/JS that displays the raw Asciinema
      timestamp value.
- [ ] Vim macros to make my life *really* easy.

More docs soon...
