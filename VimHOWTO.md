# Minitator Vim Plugin HOWTO
Minitator includes a Vim plugin for helping you power through annotating
Asciinema shell sessions in Vim!  It is assumed that this plugin will also
work in Neovim, but I do not use Neovim...

If you are new to Vim I'd recommend taking a look at at least the first few
sections of [vimtutor](https://vimschool.netlify.app/introduction/vimtutor/),
then perusing [this guide on window management in Vim](https://jitesh117.github.io/vim_stuff/buffers-windows-and-tabs-in-vim/).

## INSTALLING
### Step 1: Register plugin in your vimrc
Add the following lines to your `~/.vimrc`:

* For Vundle:
```vim
" My Librecode helpers
Plugin 'targetdisk/minitator'
au BufRead,BufNewFile *.annotated.head.json call minitator#macros()
```

* For Vim plug:
```vim
" My Librecode helpers
Plug 'targetdisk/minitator'
au BufRead,BufNewFile *.annotated.head.json call minitator#macros()
```

### Step 2: Install the plugin
Run the `:VundleInstall` command or the `:PlugInstall` command (for Vundle or
Vim Plug, respectively).

## USING
### A word on macros
The bulk of the Vim plugin's functionality is implemented using
[macros](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Macro).  Many of them require the cursor
to be in a specific position to use them.  To make this document easier to
understand, the following symbols are used throughout this guide:

| Symbol | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| ‚Üê      | The cursor must be *exactly* where the arrow is. |
| üîõ     | The cursor can be *anywhere* on the same line as this symbol. |

The remainder of this guide will describe the workflow.  Sections that use
macros will make use of symbols in the table above.

### 1: Beginning an annotation
First, open the Asciinema recording you wish to edit in your editor.  With the
file open, `:call` the `minitator#headdy()` function:

```
:call minitator#headdy()
```

The pretty-printed JSON should now open in a new `:vsplit` buffer.  See
[this page](https://jitesh117.github.io/vim_stuff/buffers-windows-and-tabs-in-vim/)
for instructions on how to move back and forth between the new buffer and the
Asciinema recording buffer.  From this point on in the guide you are expected to
know how to move back and forth between buffers on your own.

Now that your editor is ready to start annotating, it's time to open the
Minitator web player UI.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser of
choice (I like Qutebrowser, but Chromium/Firefox with the *optional* Vimium
plugin work well, as well).  See [this document](PlayerHOWTO.md) for more
information on using the Minitator web player UI.
